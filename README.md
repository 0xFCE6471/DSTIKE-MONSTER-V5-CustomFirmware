# DSTIKE MONSTER V5 Custom Firmware 2.6.2

I decide to add **Deauther Detector** from : **https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/DeauthDetector**

to my **DSTIKE MonsterV5** and I decided to upload it here for those who are interested! 

This is for educational purposes only

## How to use start Deauther Dectector : 

1) Start your DSTIKE Monster V5
2) Go to the **Scan** menu.
3) Scroll to **Deauther Detector** and click on it.
4) To be sure that the **Deauther Detector** is activated, the led will blink from BLUE to GREY/PINK *(color blindness is sometimes difficult hehe)*.
5) After the led flashes, the led stops flashing BLUE and this means that the **Deauther Detector** is running and waiting for a suspicious package.
6) If a suspicious package is detected, the led flashes between RED and OFF and stays in RED while suspcious packet is detected ! and turn to GREEN when 0 suspicious packet detcted
7) If you want to change the color or anything else, you are welcome!
